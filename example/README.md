# Documentation Examples
ezFlap's [Core Widgets documentation](https://www.ezflap.io/deep-dive/core-widgets/core-widgets.html) contains examples.

These examples can also be executed using the Example Player application in the
[ezflap_docs](https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_docs) repository:

Just do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ozlao/ezflap_docs.git
cd ezflap_docs
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build
flutter run
```

To also make changes in the examples - run the `build_runner` in "watch" mode:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
